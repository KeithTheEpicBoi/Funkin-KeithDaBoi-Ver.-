# Funkin-KeithDaBoi-Ver.-
Development Mod Folder for "Funkin' (KeithDaBoi Ver.)".

# How to setup the mod folder in Funkin' (PC ONLY)

1. Setup
    - Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://www.git-scm.com)
    - Do NOT download the repository using the Download ZIP button on GitHub or you may run into errors!
    - Instead, open a command prompt and do the following steps...
2. Run `cd directory\that\your\funkin\mods\folder\is\in` to specify which folder the command prompt is working in.
    - For example, `cd C:\Users\YOURNAME\Desktop\funkin-windows-64bit\mods` would instruct the command prompt to perform the next steps in the `mods` folder of Friday Night Funkin'.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/KeithTheEpicBoi/Funkin-KeithDaBoi-Ver.-.git` to clone the base repository.
4. Run `cd Funkin-KeithDaBoi-Ver.-` to enter the cloned repository's directory.
5. You should be good to go! To test this, run `git pull`, and you should see the Command Prompt say `Already up to date.`.
